## Planning Story

The idea for Cruelty Free came to me as I Google searched 'cruelty free brands nyc' and had to visit various websites to find the information that I was looking for. I thought, why not create a one-stop hub of information where users can find compassionate brands within their area. I used this pitch to create the user stories, wireframes and ERD and ultimately bring the app to life!
